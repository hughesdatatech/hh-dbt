  - name: fct_accrual_timing_curve
    description: >
      The accrual timing curve is a count of the number of members who converted 
      (sourced from observed conversions), grouped by the number of days it took 
      them to convert, and the type of communication the member converted 
      from (either email or customer communication). This table is leveraged
      further downstream in the forecasting process.

      further downstream in the forecasting process.

  - name: fct_marketing_touchpoints_consolidated
    description: >
      Brings together base-level marketing touchpoints, and observed conversions data
      to approximate the scheduled sends for each touchpoint (as opposed to using actual figures),
      at the customer touchpoint level. This data is then used by downstream models
      primarily for predicting conversion rates.

  - name: fct_throttled_touchpoints
    description: >
      Estimates which touchpoints are likely to be throttled. Touchpoints are throttled 
      for new customers if they represent 70% of the customers users on teams goal for 
      the year, and are in the first half of the year, or if they hit 140% of the uot 
      goal in the second half of the year. Customers with a hard cap are not throttled 
      until they go over their hard cap (ignores 70% rule from above and is agnostic 
      to half). Legacy customers without a hard cap target 140% of their yearly uot 
      goal, and do not throttle until they hit that mark (regardless of half). Note that 
      this table contains a flag indicating if a given touchpoint is expected to be 
      throttled. In other words, it contains non-throttled touchpoints as well.
